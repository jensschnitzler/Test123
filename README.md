*The Typeface of Our Time* is a design research by Jens Schnitzler which investigates influences of world views on typography and type design in various artistic movements. With insights in historical contexts it attempts to enrich the current design discourse and to empower readers to think for themselves about which design is appropriate, consistent and correct today.

It is written in [Markdown](https://ia.net/writer/support/general/markdown-guide) with [iA Writer](https://ia.net/de/writer) and made accessible with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
