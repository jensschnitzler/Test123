![„Die zeitgemäße Schrift – Studienhefte für Schrift und Formgestaltung“, july 1929, issue 9. This design magazine was published quarterly by Heintze & Blanckertz in Berlin and Leipzig. The publishers were Franz Leberecht and Paul Heinrich Richter. After the Schriftmuseum Rudolf Blanckertz was founded in 1926, Blanckertz decided to create a podium for contemporary design and founded the magazine in 1928 as one of the first design magazines ever. It was mainly devoted to a  traditional style with publication of works by Rudolf Koch or Friedrich Heinrichsen. But occasionally modernists such as Paul Renner, Edward Johnston and Hermann Zapf wrote for the magazine as well. The magazine was ceased with the number 64, 1943 due to the war and not continued after 1945.](/The-Typeface-of-Our-Time/assets/img/placeholder.png)
