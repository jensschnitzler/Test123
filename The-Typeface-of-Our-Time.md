![„Die zeitgemäße Schrift – Studienhefte für Schrift und Formgestaltung“, july 1929, issue 9. This design magazine was published quarterly by Heintze & Blanckertz in Berlin and Leipzig. The publishers were Franz Leberecht and Paul Heinrich Richter. After the *Schriftmuseum Rudolf Blanckertz* was founded in 1926, Blanckertz decided to create a podium for contemporary design and founded the magazine in 1928 as one of the first design magazines ever. It was mainly devoted to a  traditional style with publication of works by Rudolf Koch or Friedrich Heinrichsen. But occasionally modernists such as Paul Renner, Edward Johnston and Hermann Zapf wrote for the magazine as well. The magazine was ceased with the number 64, 1943 due to the war and not continued after 1945.](4)

## Introduction

#### Origin and Intention

The starting point for the research that led to this text was a type design seminar with Prof. Jovica Veljović in my master studies at HAW Hamburg. In the drafting process, I attempted to reflect my own aesthetic preferences. Which led me to the question of how my personal creative interests and thus ultimately my formal-aesthetic decisions - consciously or unconsciously - are shaped by different cultural influences and historical role models. On this basis, I researched the creative trends and attitudes in whose cultural heritage we now presumedly stand and the actual formal consequences that the respective advocates of these movements deducted from their ideological ideals. When looking at the artistic positions and their representatives many connecting nodes emerged among them: be it through embracing each other as part of the same cultural movement, by opposing attitudes and deliberate distancing from each other, by referencing previous artistical epochs and attempting to return to superseded styles and methods or, of course, by teaching and passing on artistic and social ideals from generation to generation.

Through understanding design-historical contexts this research aims at laying the foundation for tackling the following questions: How does history affect typography and typeface design today? What can we learn from the design ideologies and dogmas of the past for today's design dialogue? Which ideals should design follow today? And in this sense: is there a design that is appropriate, consistent and correct for today?

In his book *Counterpunch* font designer and theorist Fred Smeijers writes: "What history can do is help us to feel connected with the things that we do and are interested in. […] Because without such knowledge [of history] you float, without direction.“[*](#Smeijers-Counterpunch-162) Making the connection described and overcoming this aimless hovering are the intent of the book.

There is already plenty of literature on the history of typography. For each person, each font, every development and every circumstance mentioned bellow a lot of further information can be found after only a short search. The text does not intend to shed light on every single historical detail, but seeks to illustrate the larger context, highlighting particular events that point out the fact that micro- and macro-typography have always served as symbols and means of expression of zeitgeist, ideology, and worldview. Much remains unmentioned and incomplete and the informed readership will certainly miss a couple of names, such as Aldus Manutius and Francesco Griffo. 

A shortcoming which resulted from my relatively uncritical and unreflected way of researching is the reproduction of historiographic neglect and ignorance towards important female protagonists which I want to fix in a future revision of the text. Unfortunately my following considerations do not take sufficient account of the already criminally neglected, like Carol Twombly, Susan Kare, Marian Bantjes, Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Paula Scher, Muriel Cooper, Irma Boom, Linda Van Deursen and Gudrun Zapf von Hesse. 

This text is therefore not to be understood as complete. For the sake of compactness and consumability some information gaps will always remain inevitable, but others certainly must be eliminated.

The research gave the impression that the existing literature on typographic history does mention the connection to political-cultural-ideological ideas, but rather parenthetically, rarely in a context beyond a specific artistic movement or epoch, and more or less never in relation to today's design discourse. Nonetheless along with many other books and articles, the following literature helped me a lot with the development of this text: *Texte zur Typografie* by Isabel Naegele and Petra Eisele, *Read + Play* by Jean Ulysses Voelker, *Mit Schrift denken* by Ellen Lupton, *The Triumph of Typography* edited by Henk Hoeks and Ewan Lentjes, *Anarchie der Buchstaben* by Rick Poynor, *ÜberSchrift* by Erik Spiekermann, *Max Bill kontra Jan Tschichold* by Hans Rudolf Bosshard, *Buchstabengeschichte(n)* by Max Bollwage and *Counterpunch* by Fred Smeijers.

#### About the Structure of Content

The book is divided into an *introduction* (which we are in right now), a couple of *pretexts* and the *main text*. The pretexts serve the purpose to answer basic questions, to set premises and definitions, which I consider useful for the following main text, and to already emphasize some recurring motifs in the following history of typography.

The following main text shows a (more or less) chronological, historical overview of the interweaving of typography and worldview and shows how different movements consciously demarcated and delimited from each other within their formal aesthetics as part of representing their individual identity and ideology.

The text starts out in the age of classical antiquity, which, as the cradle of latin script, takes on a special historical role and was later used frequently by designers as a benchmark of nostalgic recollection. It is followed by a jump until shortly before the invention of Gutenberg’s printing press, the moment in which the typeface design, as it is understood here in contrast to calligraphic writing, actually came into being in the works of the early punchcutters, like Nicolas Jenson. From this point on the text follows a relatively linear representation of historical developments until the beginning of the 20th century. From the turn of the century and the beginning of modernism the observed events are condensing and a strictly chronological sequence can no longer be maintained. Accordingly, the narrative thread becomes more fragmentary and erratic. The text ends with the consideration of our current state of today as a result of the previously summarized historical development.

The main text is accompanied by marginal notes, which contain various information: explanations of technical and economic developments that have had a strong influence on the design of their time, brief information on persons and trends mentioned and additional comments from various typographical experts.

Many mentioned datings, such as in the heading "Gothic (12th - 15th century)," may be a matter of interpretation, since sources often not quite concur. They thus serve more to convey a relative chronology of events, persons and works, as a precise definition. Fortunately, it is not decisive for the understanding of the text whether the Roman imperial era took place a century earlier or later, or whether the Swiss Style began five years earlier, or whether a typeface is dated by the difficult-to-retrace date of first drawing or its more easily verifiable publication date. Of course I am very happy about being pointed to any possible misstatements and misunderstandings regarding all given information.

## Preliminary Notes

The following introductory remarks precede the historical overview in the main part and clarify basic assumptions, connections and meanings. Here, the link between typography and world view is shown first, then it will be explained why the technical and economic influences on type design and typography can not be left out, then it will be clarified, which weight the research applies to the two different areas of designing a typeface and applying a typeface, i.e. typography, and finally recurring, superordinate motifs are presented, which seem to be interwoven with the typographical history: architecture, religiosity and a way of thinking shaped by the philosophical enlightenment.
