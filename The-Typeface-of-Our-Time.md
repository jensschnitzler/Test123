The publishers were Franz Leberecht and Paul Heinrich Richter. After the Schriftmuseum Rudolf Blanckertz was founded in 1926, Blanckertz decided to create a podium for contemporary design and founded the magazine in 1928 as one of the first design magazines ever. It was mainly devoted to a  traditional style with publication of works by Rudolf Koch or Friedrich Heinrichsen. But occasionally modernists such as Paul Renner, Edward Johnston and Hermann Zapf wrote for the magazine as well. The magazine was ceased with the number 64, 1943 due to the war and not continued after 1945.](/The-Typeface-of-Our-Time/assets/img/placeholder.png)

## Introduction

#### Origin and Intention

The starting point for the research that led to this text was a type design seminar with Prof. Jovica Veljović in my master studies at HAW Hamburg. In the drafting process, I attempted to reflect my own aesthetic preferences. Which led me to the question of how my personal creative interests and thus ultimately my formal-aesthetic decisions - consciously or unconsciously - are shaped by different cultural influences and historical role models. On this basis, I researched the creative trends and attitudes in whose cultural heritage we now presumedly stand and the actual formal consequences that the respective advocates of these movements deducted from their ideological ideals. When looking at the artistic positions and their representatives many connecting nodes emerged among them: be it through embracing each other as part of the same cultural movement, by opposing attitudes and deliberate distancing from each other, by referencing previous artistical epochs and attempting to return to superseded styles and methods or, of course, by teaching and passing on artistic and social ideals from generation to generation.

Through understanding design-historical contexts this research aims at laying the foundation for tackling the following questions: How does history affect typography and typeface design today? What can we learn from the design ideologies and dogmas of the past for today's design dialogue? Which ideals should design follow today? And in this sense: is there a design that is appropriate, consistent and correct for today?

In his book *Counterpunch* font designer and theorist Fred Smeijers writes: "What history can do is help us to feel connected with the things that we do and are interested in. […] Because without such knowledge [of history] you float, without direction.“[*](#Smeijers-Counterpunch-162) Making the connection described and overcoming this aimless hovering are the intent of the book.

There is already plenty of literature on the history of typography. For each person, each font, every development and every circumstance mentioned bellow a lot of further information can be found after only a short search. The text does not intend to shed light on every single historical detail, but seeks to illustrate the larger context, highlighting particular events that point out the fact that micro- and macro-typography have always served as symbols and means of expression of zeitgeist, ideology, and worldview. Much remains unmentioned and incomplete and the informed readership will certainly miss a couple of names, such as Aldus Manutius and Francesco Griffo.

A shortcoming which resulted from my relatively uncritical and unreflected way of researching is the reproduction of historiographic neglect and ignorance towards important female protagonists which I want to fix in a future revision of the text. Unfortunately my following considerations do not take sufficient account of the already criminally neglected, like Carol Twombly, Susan Kare, Marian Bantjes, Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Paula Scher, Muriel Cooper, Irma Boom, Linda Van Deursen and Gudrun Zapf von Hesse.

This text is therefore not to be understood as complete. For the sake of compactness and consumability some information gaps will always remain inevitable, but others certainly must be eliminated.

The research gave the impression that the existing literature on typographic history does mention the connection to political-cultural-ideological ideas, but rather parenthetically, rarely in a context beyond a specific artistic movement or epoch, and more or less never in relation to today's design discourse. Nonetheless along with many other books and articles, the following literature helped me a lot with the development of this text: *Texte zur Typografie* by Isabel Naegele and Petra Eisele, *Read + Play* by Jean Ulysses Voelker, *Mit Schrift denken* by Ellen Lupton, *The Triumph of Typography* edited by Henk Hoeks and Ewan Lentjes, *Anarchie der Buchstaben* by Rick Poynor, *ÜberSchrift* by Erik Spiekermann, *Max Bill kontra Jan Tschichold* by Hans Rudolf Bosshard, *Buchstabengeschichte(n)* by Max Bollwage and *Counterpunch* by Fred Smeijers.

#### About the Structure of Content

The book is divided into an *introduction* (which we are in right now), a couple of *pretexts* and the *main text*. The pretexts serve the purpose to answer basic questions, to set premises and definitions, which I consider useful for the following main text, and to already emphasize some recurring motifs in the following history of typography.

The following main text shows a (more or less) chronological, historical overview of the interweaving of typography and worldview and shows how different movements consciously demarcated and delimited from each other within their formal aesthetics as part of representing their individual identity and ideology.

The text starts out in the age of classical antiquity, which, as the cradle of latin script, takes on a special historical role and was later used frequently by designers as a benchmark of nostalgic recollection. It is followed by a jump until shortly before the invention of Gutenberg’s printing press, the moment in which the typeface design, as it is understood here in contrast to calligraphic writing, actually came into being in the works of the early punchcutters, like Nicolas Jenson. From this point on the text follows a relatively linear representation of historical developments until the beginning of the 20th century. From the turn of the century and the beginning of modernism the observed events are condensing and a strictly chronological sequence can no longer be maintained. Accordingly, the narrative thread becomes more fragmentary and erratic. The text ends with the consideration of our current state of today as a result of the previously summarized historical development.

The main text is accompanied by marginal notes, which contain various information: explanations of technical and economic developments that have had a strong influence on the design of their time, brief information on persons and trends mentioned and additional comments from various typographical experts.

Many mentioned datings, such as in the heading "Gothic (12th - 15th century)," may be a matter of interpretation, since sources often not quite concur. They thus serve more to convey a relative chronology of events, persons and works, as a precise definition. Fortunately, it is not decisive for the understanding of the text whether the Roman imperial era took place a century earlier or later, or whether the Swiss Style began five years earlier, or whether a typeface is dated by the difficult-to-retrace date of first drawing or its more easily verifiable publication date. Of course I am very happy about being pointed to any possible misstatements and misunderstandings regarding all given information.

## Preliminary Notes

The following introductory remarks precede the historical overview in the main part and clarify basic assumptions, connections and meanings. Here, the link between typography and world view is shown first, then it will be explained why the technical and economic influences on type design and typography can not be left out, then it will be clarified, which weight the research applies to the two different areas of designing a typeface and applying a typeface, i.e. typography, and finally recurring, superordinate motifs are presented, which seem to be interwoven with the typographical history: architecture, religiosity and a way of thinking shaped by the philosophical enlightenment.

### Correlation of Type Design, Zeitgeist and World View

Trends and movements in type design are always tied to contemporary social, political, cultural and technical conditions.[\*](#Naegele-Eisele-Ludwig-Neue-Schriften-New-Typefaces-23) An interplay of world view, fashion and visual-formal manifestations can be observed as a central subject in many artistic movements. According to Johannes Bergerhausen, Phillip Pape and Robert Paulmann, many writing systems were created in order to deliberately set themselves apart politically: The alphabet has historically been used repeatedly as a means of demonstrating independence and one's own identity. The emergence of the Carolingian minuscule, for example, had a political background, for its use was decreed by emperor Charlemagne (742-814) to standardize communication and thus strengthen and organize its Western European empire.[\*](#Voelker-Glaab-Read+Play-121) The Renaissance Antiqua also emerged as a demarcating identification symbol of a particular political world view. Other obvious examples of this phenomenon are classicism and romanticism, as demonstrated in the respective following sections. And even in the recent past instances of this relationship occurred, like the abolition of the Arabic writing system in Turkey (1928) under Kemal Atatürk and the change of former Eastern Bloc countries from Arabic to Cyrillic and later to the Latin writing system.[\*](#Voelker-Glaab-Read+Play-121)

The „history of development of writing [is] in a sense a "graphology" of past cultures," Adrian Frutiger writes.[\*](#Frutiger-Der-Mensch-und-seine-Zeichen-166) The emotionality with which typographic disputes were fought out in the 20th century can only be explained by higher values ​​being at stake, beyond the simple printed matter. Jean Ulysses Voelker writes in "Read + Play" that "representatives of historicism [...] would have probably liked to see Jan Tschichold getting stoned to death because of his New Typography and the Bauhaus protagonists [...] would have accused designers like David Carson of typographic crimes, if they had seen his magazine Raygun during their lifetime."[\*](Voelker-Glaab-Read-Play-83) In The Politics of Style, Philip B. Meggs explains: "clashes between design factions represent nothing more than a struggle for the heart and soul of a culture“.[\*](Meggs-The-Politics-of-Style-in-Bierut-Drenttel-Heller-Holland-Looking-Closer-2-55) In the history of type design, traditionalists and conservative dogmatists have always been adamant about new technologies, especially when these technologies encouraged disrespect for the old rules and conventions, writes Fred Smeijers in Counterpunch, confirming that the moral and artistic claims to truth go hand in hand.[\*](Smeijers-Counterpunch-180)

For some readers, a connection between worldview and type design may still seem strange or unlikely. A font choice is just a question of fashion and taste, not a deeper moral or political statement, one would think. This perception may be related to the increasing democratization of type design and typography, which trivializes practice and products, and the media-cultural transition from the "graphosphere" to the "video-sphere," as reflected by Régis Debray in "Socialism: A Life-Cycle "describes.[\*](Debray-Socialism-A-Life-Cycle) The graphosphere represents a period from Gutenberg to around the middle of the 20th century, in which the text in the book and newspaper represented the authoritative social information medium. This was replaced by the contemporary "video-sphere", the age of the image. The media image dominates the television and the Internet and has dethroned the book, the text and thus the meaning of typefaces. Along with this, I see the disappearance of the typographer's self-image as an 'intellectual worker' and, as Debray mentions, as socially critical actor, or as Eric Gill differentiates between the intellectual, responsible designer and the 'ordinary worker' without 'intellectual sensibility' merely fulfilling its role as a tool in the industrial machinery.[\*](Gill-An-Essay-On-Typography-11–13) Through our societal, economical and cultural development designers today increasingly find themselves in the latter category.

However, type still plays an important role in visual communication and even short-lived fashions without immediate political claims are indicators of procedures taking place in the inner life of culture and society. And even without type designers and typographers writing up idealistic manifestos, a choice of form can communicate an inherent philosophical or political attitude.

In 1988, Otl Aicher writes that typefaces are highly political and that the typographer is a "homo politicus". „even the question of whether ragged typesetting (Flattersatz) or justified typesetting (Blocksatz) will be an essential statement, whether [the typographer] is a follower of principles of order or of freedom. only those in favor of law and order prefer center alignment (Mittelachse). and who chooses the center alignment is, whether consciously or unconsciously, a man of "order", the symmetrical enforced conformity (Gleichschaltung).“[\*](Aicher-Typografie-in-Eisele-Naegele-Texte-zur-Typografie-178–179)

Even if a typographer only wanted to follow the zeitgeist and its fashions, Aicher said, he still acted politically. It could either "manipulate, beautify," or "push for meaningfulness" and "prevent us from being deceived or distracted." Most unspoken information would come to us through the vehicle of printing, so either an "optimum of mediation [...] or an optimum of appearance and facade" could be pursued. This makes the activity of the typographer political.[\*](Voelker-Glaab-Read+Play-31)

Commercial fashion phenomena can also take the form of a compliant, domesticated, critique-liberated and popularized version of a more radical political ideal. In much the same way as the British pop-girl group Spice Girls (1994-2012) appeared as a commercial and politically defused plagiarism of the punky Riot Grrrl movement (early 1990s), graphic design –often with a combination of ignorance and nostalgic transfiguration – imitates past artistic movements as mere superficial styles, abandoning original political relevance and social context.

An example of this style imitation is the popular copying of functionalist and constructivist aesthetics. In this context, contemporary critics of postmodernism declared the 1980s and 1990s to be the "Age of Plunder“.[\*](Poynor-Anarchie-der-Zeichen-79–80) The criticism referred to the formal imitation of modernist design from the 1920s. For the experts, this kind of design was just a pseudo-modernity parasitically nourished by modernity, demanding prestige and style, winning customers and prizes without reflecting on its underlying politics and philosophy. Rick Poynor cites the cultural critic Jon Savage, who "recognized a close connection between a historical design style and a conservative attitude [and argued] the pseudo-modernity would contribute to the prevailing conservatism of the Reagan era“.[\*](Poynor-Anarchie-der-Zeichen-79–80)

The understanding of the volatile, mutable style trend as part of a larger social development emerged as early as 1966 in Konrad Friedrich Bauer's speech at the opening of the exhibition „Schrift of unserer Zeit“. On trends and the future of type, he said, "We have no reason to disparage the word ‚trend‘. What we call […] trend is a small, sometimes flighty step in the wave movement, which appears in large curves of transforming styles. The change of styles is […] as necessary as the change of seasons and generations. The new is there and must be there because it is new. It looks at some part of our environment with new eyes, with new, lively compassion, which legitimizes its own existence sufficiently."[\*](Eisele-Naegele-Texte-zur-Typografie-148)

The text below uses a number of terms like trend, zeitgeist, philosophy, dogma, ideology and weltanschauung as different comparative forms, more or less lined on a scale of radicality.

### The Typeface of Our Time – Suitable for Photomontage

The history of typography is also the history of methods of communication and production, writes Jean Ulysses Voelker.[\*](Voelker-Glaab-Read+Play-3) The possibilities and restrictions of the underlying techniques, which have been developed over the centuries, such as lead typesetting, lithography or photo typesetting, provided the boundaries of the designers’ creative playing field. As exciting as the possible connections between writing and ideology may be, it should be emphasized that "fonts and typography are never designed in a vacuum," as Steven Heller and A. M. Cassandre express it in their essay *The Meanings of Type*. Although social and political influences have an impact on design, practical and commercial motivations are predominant.[\*](Naegele-Eisele-Ludwig-Neue-Schriften-New-Typefaces-23) In typography, there are always "trends and movements that are bound to social, political and cultural issues [but also to] technical conditions," notes the designer André Baldinger.[\*](Naegele-Eisele-Ludwig-Neue-Schriften-New-Typefaces-23) In order not to transfigure creative processes and works of art as purely idealistic, detached from all banal restrictions, influences and intentions, the decisive factors of economy and technology should not be ignored. For this reason, the text is supplemented and contextualized with comments on these topics.

The technical possibilities have always influenced designed forms. They always represent both limitation and challenge at the same time. Looking at the late 19th and the late 20th century can also give the impression that much was only designed because technology allowed it. At the same time, according to Adrian Frutiger, the ever increasing need for textual media forces technicians to invent faster methods of typesetting and printing.[\*](Frutiger-Der-Mensch-und-seine-Zeichen-197) "The history of writing is a history of technical limitations," writes Erik Spiekermann[\*](Spiekermann-ÜberSchrift-125) and Jean Ulysses Voelker agrees that the "history of typography […] was also the history of communication and production methods".[\*](Voelker-Glaab-Read+Play-3)

### Between Type Design and Typography

This book focuses on the relationships between worldviews and type design, but this is not possible under exclusion of the field of type application, namely typography and graphic design. This is primarily due to two reasons: First, typefaces only really exist through their application and once applied, its formal voice is only one among many in the overall design.[\*](Biľak-Conceptual-Type?) Second, many of the people listed below were or are both designing type and applying type. Their type design and typography come from the same underlying attitude. They both constitute and complement each other.

A separation of these fields therefore seems unreasonable. Nevertheless with the emphasis type design I attempt to explore to what extent the form of a typeface itself reveals something about Zeitgeist and ideals and contributes to the overall typographic expression in the communication of an attitude. The different viewpoints portrayed below are from people with very various perspectives and fields of work. Some were engaged in type design, typography, marketing as well as print production, while others were or are specialized in a niche, which is also due to the fact that the processes of work and the responsibilities of design and production have been constantly changing in recent centuries. However, this procedural shift is a completely new issue, which is why it won’t be thoroughly discussed at this point.

Studying visual expressions of a worldview can become increasingly complex when a gap opens up between the design and the application of a typeface. On one side of this gap are the users, such as graphic designers and typographers. Here, for example, the typographer Wolfgang Weingart may be mentioned: He preferably used the Helvetica, according to the strict Swiss school in which he was taught and which carries its own dogmatics in itself. However, Weingart broke with conventions through an experimental, free setting of type. His artistic counter-thesis was defined through his typographic treatment of the existing font and did not require any new typefaces.

A similar discrepancy between the original intention and the application of a typeface is described by the typeface designer Peter Biľak with regard to his typeface *Fedra*: Biľak writes that he originally designed this typeface (a „deprotestanized univers“[\*](Lupton-Mit-Schrift-Denken-U2)) on behalf of an insurance company, strongly determined by the requirements of the client, who in the end decided against using Fedra as their corporate typeface. Instead, Biľak published it as an extended font family and was able to make an interesting observation in the following years. Fedra came into use in a wide variety of areas: on building facades, in children's books, in bibles, even in the visual identity of a terrorist organization, but apparently never in a single insurance company.[\*](Biľak-Conceptual-Type?) Biľak concluded: „There is probably no other discipline where the difference between the intention of the author and intention of the user can be so great.“[\*](Biľak-Conceptual-Type?) The development of the symbolic meaning of a typeface can thus elude its own designer.

### Type as Symbol

A fundamental concept for the contemplation of type and worldview is what I generally want to describe as "narrative design" or specifically „type as symbol". It is now a widespread recognition that design itself is a medium that can be decoded and understood by the viewer, regardless of the information conveyed by, for example, a coexisting textual level. The same applies to the shape of typeface. Andres Janser puts it this way in his essay "Mehr Schrift!": „Type does [...] two very different things: it serves as a text that transports content; but it is also a visual sign with an autonomous aesthetic function."[\*](Janser-Mehr-Schrift!-in:-Frische-Schriften/Fresh-Type-3) In practice, this means that even a text, whose language we are not familiar with, reveals information to us. Provided that we are able to decode the culturally determined visual code, the design provides us with context - and through the form alone the author’s taste, zeitgeist or attitude may reveal itself to us.

The typefaces familiar to us today are often formal manifestations of social circumstances of their origin and testimonies of artistic, philosophical or political convictions of the designer. Philip B. Meggs explains in his essay "The Politics of Style": "[Form] becomes part of the message: it can declare a generation, an attitude, or even a lifestyle."[\*](Meggs-The-Politics-of-Style-in:-Bierut-Drenttel-Heller-Holland-Looking-Closer-2-55) Typography conveys meaning. The use of a particular letterform can convey hipness, authority, playfulness, or power.[\*](Righthand-Postmodernisms-New-Typography) Through the correct and appropriate font choice, the typographer „sheds light on a text to produce knowledge and energy“, as Robert Bringhurst puts it. Thus, the additional level of aesthetics can contribute information to the level of content.[\*](Bringhurst-The-Elements-of-Typographic-Style-98)

Michael Rock discusses the explanatory power of form in his influential essay "Fuck Content": Beatrice Warde's metaphor of the "crystal goblet" is the obsolete assumption that there can be a true neutral form. In the eyes of her advocates, anyone who still favores ornaments is considered ignorant and primitive. "Agitators on both sides of the ideological spectrum took up the debate: minimalists embraced it as a manifesto; maximalists decried it as aesthetic fascism.“[\*](Rock-Fuck-Content) One must only think of Piet Zwart's catalog for Nederlandsche Kabelfabriek or the travel posters by A.M. Cassandre or Herbert Matter or the New Wave works by Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman and Dan Friedman or the punk design of Jamie Reid - in all these examples the manipulation of form has an essential, even "transformative meaning" in the sense that the design contributes a great deal to the overall message, says Rock.[\*](Rock-Fuck-Content) Only the acceptance of a meaningful form would make it possible to even discuss the content of a typeface or the relevance of a surf magazine’s typography (he is probably referring to David Carson’s Magazine Beach Culture) in the design dialogue. Just as a movie is not as much defined by a topic, but rather by the approach to the topic, design decisions bring their own content to the table.[\*](Rock-Fuck-Content)

Rock clarifies: Form is information, form is a sign of communication, form carries meaning. However, this meaning is fluid. It is not fixed, universal or natural, but depends on culture and is in a continuous change of renewal and remodeling. A prominent and extreme example of this is the way in which the Nazis dealt with the *Fraktur*, which until 1941 was regarded as the national folk type, but was then abruptly banned as a "Jewish letter" by means of a "Führer's decree" and replaced by the antiqua. It was a (failed) attempt to impose a societal reconnotation of the Blackletter form.

The versatility of symbolic meanings can be further traced to Jan Tschichold's radical change of heart, who in the 1940s attacked the "Neue Typografie" as inherently fascist and misguided - a style he co-founded himself in the 1920s. This in turn led to a backlash by his former followers, who from now on considered him a traitor, as the American graphic designer *Alvin Lustig* characterized him.[\*](Heller-Cassandre/The-Meanings-of-Type)

Alvin Lustig (1915-1955), book designer, graphic designer, type designer.

Aesthetic concepts and meanings, even the actual capability of recognizing signs in the first place, are strongly related to their time and context. While today it is difficult for a majority to fluidly read blackletter typefaces with its complex shapes and unfamiliar construction, it was the dominant form in Germany before World War II. Baskerville, a transitional Baroque antiquary was rejected as ugly and illegible in 1757 and is now considered one of the most useful typefaces for long texts.[\*](Poynor/Type-and-Deconstruction-in-the-Digital-Era,-in:-Typography-Now:-The-Next-Wave/8)

Meaningful, culturally dominant symbols have always been the subject of rejection and demarcation for new generations of designers. For example, the postmodernists rejected the omnipresent typefaces *Helvetica* and *Times*, which they associated with conservatism and globalized capitalism as part of the so-called *International Style*. The new typeface design of the early digital era was bizarre, personal and unrestrictedly subjective. The voice of modernist typography no longer proclaimed a socialist utopia, instead it was rejected as authoritarian, restrictive, lifeless, and too corporate.[\*](Poynor/Type-and-Deconstruction-in-the-Digital-Era,-in:-Typography-Now:-The-Next-Wave/8) None of the existing typefaces gave him the voice he needed for his typography, Jeff Keedy described the contemporary situation. "They just don’t relate to my experiences in my life. They are about somebody else’s experiences, which don’t belong to me."[\*](Poynor/Type-and-Deconstruction-in-the-Digital-Era,-in:-Typography-Now:-The-Next-Wave/8) His colleague Barry Deck, much as Michael Rock, argued that type design and typography would have to replace the myth of typographic transparency, against a more realistic attitude towards a form that has inherent meaning.[\*](Poynor/Type-and-Deconstruction-in-the-Digital-Era,-in:-Typography-Now:-The-Next-Wave/8)
